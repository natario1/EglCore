New versions are released through GitHub, so the reference page is the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/natario1/Egloo/releases) page.

Starting from v0.3.1, you can [support development](https://github.com/sponsors/natario1) through the GitHub Sponsors program. 
Companies can share a tiny part of their revenue and get private support hours in return. Thanks!
